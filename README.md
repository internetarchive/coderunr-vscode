    CodeRunr - VSCode Extension
</h1>

Configure shell commands and related file patterns, commands will be executed when matched files were saved.


## Features

You can specify status bar messages which will show before and after commands executing, such that they will tell you what's happening and not distrub you much:

If you prefer running commands in vscode terminal, which keeps message colors and give more feedback details, change the `runIn` option to `terminal`.

If you need to run VS Code's commands change `runIn` option to `vscode`


## Configuration

| Name                             | Description
| ---                              | ---
| `CodeRunr.statusMessageTimeout` | Specify the timeout millisecond after which the status bar message will hide, default value is `3000`, means 3 seconds.
| `CodeRunr.commands`             | Specify the array of shell commands to execute and related info, its child options as below.
| `CodeRunr.shell`                | Specify in which shell the commands are executed, defaults to the default vscode shell.


### Command Options

| Name                              | Description
| ---                               | ---
| `commands[].match`                | Specify a RegExp source to match file path. E.g.: `\\.scss$` can used to match scss files.
| `commands[].notMatch`             | Specify a RegExp source, the file that whole path match it will be excluded. E.g.: `[\\\\\\/]_[\\w-]+\\.scss$` can be used to exclude scss library files.
| `commands[].globMatch`            | Specify a glob expression, the file that whole path match it will be included. E.g.: `**/*.scss` will match all scss files. Here it didn't provide a `globNotMatch` pattern because glob expression can do so, please reference to https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer.
| `commands[].command`              | Specify the shell command to execute. You may include variable substitution like what to do in [VSCode Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_variable-substitution).
| `commands[].forcePathSeparator`   | Force path separator in variable substitution to be `/`, `\\`, default is not specified.
| `commands[].async`                | All the commands with `async: false` will run in a sequence, means run next after previous completed. Default value is `true`. |
| `commands[].runningStatusMessage` | Specify the status bar message when the shell command begin to run, supports variable substitution too. Only works when `runIn=backend`.
| `commands[].finishStatusMessage`  | Specify the status bar message after the shell command finished executing, also supports variable substitution. Only works when `runIn=backend`.
| `commands[].workingDirectoryAsCWD`| Specify the vscode working directory as shell CWD (Current Working Directory). Only works when `runIn=backend`.
| `commands[].runIn`                | See list below.
 - `backend`: Run command silently and show messages in output channel, you can specify runningStatusMessage and finishStatusMessage to give you a little feekback. Choose this when you don't want to be disturbed.
 - `terminal`: Run command in vscode terminal, which keeps message colors. Choose this when you want to get feedback details.
 - `vscode`: Run vscode's command. Choose this if you want to execute vscode's own command or a command of a particular extension.


### Sample Configuration

```js
{
    "CodeRunr.statusMessageTimeout": 3000,
    "CodeRunr.commands": [
        {
            // Match scss files except names start with `_`.
            "match": ".*\\.scss$",
            "notMatch": "[\\\\\\/]_[^\\\\\\/]*\\.scss$",
            "command": "node-sass ${file} ${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.css",
            "runIn": "backend",
            "runningStatusMessage": "Compiling ${fileBasename}",
            "finishStatusMessage": "${fileBasename} compiled"
        },
        {
            // Match less files except names start with `_`.
            "globMatch": "**/[^_]*.less",
            "command": "node-sass ${file} ${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.css",
            "runIn": "terminal"
        },
        {
            "match": ".*\\.py$",
            "command": "python.runLinting",
            "runIn": "vscode"
        }
    ]
}
```


### Variable Substitution

Can be used in `command`, `runningStatusMessage`, `finishStatusMessage`, `globMatch`.

Note that if `forcePathSeparator` specified, separators in these variables will be replaced.
